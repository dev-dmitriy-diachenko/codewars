/* Task:

This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.

Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.

// Simple tests:   
console.log(preFizz(1), " => [1]");
console.log(preFizz(2), " => [1,2]");
console.log(preFizz(3), " => [1,2,3]");
console.log(preFizz(4), " => [1,2,3,4]");
console.log(preFizz(5), " => [1,2,3,4,5]");
